# logic-locking

This repository will gradually be built to support learning about logic locking. 

For now, it includes an example formula that accompanies the [arXiv manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10466) and a copy of logictools by Tanel Tammet, availble [here](https://github.com/tammet/logictools). The copy is just for archival purposes at this stage, it's probably better to use [https://logictools.org/](https://logictools.org/) directly at this point.
